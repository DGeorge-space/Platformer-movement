# Platformer-movement

Using C# and Unity I have begun a quest to build the perfect controller for a 2-D platformer with precise tight controls and mid air movement. This project is highly subjective and experimental, therefore is subject to change frequently. If you use unity I'd love to get some feedback on what you think!
